# Tech used:
`HTML 5` `CSS 3` `JavaScript ES6` `Vite` `React.js` `Sass`

# Install all dependencies to use this website as a template:

`npm install`

Afterward:

`npm start`

# Optimization: 
- Could possibly optimized pictures loading effect with npm react lazy loading package. 
- Could add slide animation motion to make a slide navigation menu on tablet and mobile viewport instead of pop-up menu.
- Could possibly add a contact page in the future if needed.
